      " |  of token indices (one example = 1D tensor of integer token indices) or a\n",

      " |  \n",
      " |  The vocabulary for the layer must be either supplied on construction or\n",
      " |  learned via `adapt()`. When this layer is adapted, it will analyze the\n",
      " |  dataset, determine the frequency of individual string values, and create a\n",

      " |  depending on the configuration options for this layer; if there are more\n",
      " |  unique values in the input than the maximum vocabulary size, the most\n",

      " |  3. When using a custom callable for `split`, the data received by the\n",
      " |     callable will have the 1st dimension squeezed out - instead of\n",
      " |     `[[\"string to split\"], [\"another string to split\"]]`, the Callable will\n",
      " |     see `[\"string to split\", \"another string to split\"]`. The callable should\n",
      " |     return a Tensor with the first dimension containing the split tokens -\n",
      " |     in this example, we should see something like `[[\"string\", \"to\",\n",
